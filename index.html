            <h3><b><i><u>Dalat University</u></i></b></h3>
            <p><i>Dalat University or the University of Dalat (Vietnamese: Đại học Đà Lạt, French: Université de Dalat; formerly Viện Đại học Đà Lạt) is a university in the city of Đà Lạt, Lâm Đồng Province, Vietnam. The original Dalat University was established in 1957 — after support of and requests by Archbishop Pierre Martin Ngô Đình Thục — by the Council of Vietnamese Catholic Bishops as a centre for education. After the Fall of Saigon in 1975, the Vietnamese name was changed to Đại học Đà Lạt (Dalat University). Today, it is a multidisciplinary university that offers undergraduate and graduate education for the Central Highlands region.

                Dalat University is in the center of Dalat — a popular tourist city on Lâm Viên Plateau with a year-round cool climate, vast pine forests, flowers, fog, and waterfalls.
                
                The campus sits on a hilly area of 40 hectares north of Xuan Huong Lake, beside an international 18-hole golf course. It is a romantic and beautiful spot. There is a variety of styled buildings hidden throughout the pine trees. The campus offers peace and quiet which is an ideal atmosphere for learning and research.
                
                At present, the university offers over 30 programs at the undergraduate level and a graduate program in Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, History, Philology. In addition, a doctoral degree program in Mathematics is offered.</i></p>
